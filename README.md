## [Simon Game](https://jareksopinski.github.io/simon-game)

A faithful digital recreation of a [popular memory game from the eighties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)).

After game is turned on, it will start displaying a pattern of sounds and flashes. On every turn the pattern is increased by one step and player has to repeat it. In case of failure, the pattern will be repeated by a computer. Player wins by succesfully repeating 20 steps. Then the game restarts.

It is possible to play in a strict mode, which causes restart after every failure.
